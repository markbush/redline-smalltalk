"category: instance creation"

+ value: anInteger
    "Answer an instance of Character whose value is the argument, anInteger. The value is associated with an element of
     the ASCII character set. For example, Character value: 65 is a capital 'A'."
    self notImplementedYet.

+ digitValue: anInteger
    "Answer an instance of Character whose digit value is the argument, anInteger. For example, answer $9 if the
     argument is 9; answer $0 for 0; answer $A for 10, and $Z for 35. This method is useful in parsing numbers into
     strings. Typically, only Characters up to $F are useful (for base 16 numbers)."
